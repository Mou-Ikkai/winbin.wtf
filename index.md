## How to find a binary
This site is structured exactly like a C: drive on a normal Windows install. To find documentation on the file you are looking for, just add its path to the end of this site's URL. For example, the documentation for calc.exe can be found at:

    https://winbin.wtf/Windows/System32/calc.exe

If you can't find the page for the file you are looking for, then its documentation doesn't exist yet.

## Scope

The scope of this documentation is only files that come with a base install of any Windows version. This does not include new binaries installed by the control panel item "Turn Windows features on or off." If/when all default Windows binaries are documented, the scope of this documentation may expand.
